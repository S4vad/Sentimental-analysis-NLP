## Sentimental-analysis-NLP


Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. It involves classifying text into different categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral, based on the underlying sentiment.

Naive Bayes classifier is a simple probabilistic algorithm commonly used for sentiment analysis. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge or evidence.

In the context of sentiment analysis, the Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of each word in the text is independent of the presence of other words. This is known as the "naive" assumption. Despite its simplicity, the Naive Bayes classifier has shown good performance in various text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis.

To perform sentiment analysis using the Naive Bayes classifier, the first step is to build a training dataset. This dataset consists of labeled examples, where each example is a piece of text associated with a sentiment label (e.g., positive or negative). The training data is used to estimate the probabilities required by the classifier.

The Naive Bayes classifier calculates the probability of a given sentiment label (e.g., positive) given the presence of certain words in the text. It does this by multiplying the probabilities of each word occurring in positive texts. The classifier also calculates the same probabilities for negative and neutral labels.
